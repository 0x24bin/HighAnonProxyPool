# ProxyPool
- A tool that adds/checks/cleans Proxy Records
- Flexible Access to the Proxy Database, simply by using its interfaces
- Currently ONLY supports HTTP and HTTPS


# How It Works?
- Loops through proxies
- Checks their connection availability and anonymity.
- Deletes the proxy record if found unavailable or non-anonymous.
